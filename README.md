This is the repository in which I'll keep track of the development of my Integrative Project (final project I have to build for the technician course).

There are 4 activities which work as guidelines to what will be seen here. They can be find by the names "UC05_atividade01_victoria3", "UC05_atividade02_victoria3", and "UC05_atividade03_victoria3".

I will also organise them (and all the tasks derived from them) in a kanban, so that if you're interested in the project, you can have a more global view of its processes.
